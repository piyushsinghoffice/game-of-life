Conway's Game of Life - Rules
The Game of Life is a cellular automaton created by mathematician John Conway in 1970. It's a zero-player game where you set up an initial configuration and watch it evolve.

The Rules
Each cell in the grid can be either alive (colored) or dead (empty). On each generation, the following rules apply:

Birth: A dead cell with exactly 3 living neighbors becomes alive
Survival: A living cell with 2 or 3 living neighbors stays alive
Death by isolation: A living cell with fewer than 2 neighbors dies
Death by overcrowding: A living cell with more than 3 neighbors dies
Neighbors
Each cell has 8 neighbors: the cells directly adjacent horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.

Interesting Patterns
Still lifes: Patterns that don't change (like the Block)
Oscillators: Patterns that repeat after a fixed number of generations (like the Blinker)
Spaceships: Patterns that move across the grid (like the Glider)
Methuselahs: Small patterns that take many generations to stabilize
